### Postdoctoral fellowships in Exoplanet and Planetary Sciences and Numerical Astrophysics at Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Chile

The Faculty of Engineering and Sciences and the Faculty of Liberal Arts of Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez (UAI) in Santiago and Viña del Mar, Chile, have recently created an Astrophysics group with a focus in the areas of exoplanets, planetary science, numerical astrophysics and astroinformatics. We invite astronomers to apply for UAI sponsoring of FONDECYT postdoctoral fellowships to carry out independent research in these areas. The FONDECYT fellowships consist of 3-year postdoctoral grants of the Chilean research funding agency (ANID), which have to be sponsored by a UAI faculty member. The starting date of the awarded FONDECYT fellowships is planned for March 15, 2021. 

The Astrophysics group at UAI is currently composed of Profs. Rafael Brahm, Jorge Cuadra, Andres Jordan and Gijs Mulders (starting Nov 2020). The principal research lines of the group are the detection and characterization of transiting exoplanets, observation of exoplanet atmospheres, synthesis of exoplanet populations, planet formation, small telescope instrumentation, and numerical simulations of the Galactic centre, protoplanetary and circumbinary discs. Chile hosts some of the most advanced astronomical facilities in the world, such as ALMA, the Vera Rubin observatory, the ESO Very Large Telescopes, the Magellan 6.5m telescopes, Gemini South, among others. While a resident at UAI, the candidate will qualify as a member of the Chilean community with 10% privileged access to all of these facilities. 

The official call from [ANID](https://www.anid.cl/concursos/) is expected to occur during August. The fellowships will have a duration of up to 3 years, and the funds cover the researcher’s salary, health insurance, operational expenses, flight tickets, and relocation expenses. Researchers are eligible if they have received their PhD on or after Jan 1, 2017 (or Jan 1, 2016, for women who recently had a child), and before the application deadline. We ask researchers interested in applying to the FONDECYT postdoctoral fellowship with the sponsorship of the UAI Astrophysics group to submit the following documents to Prof. Rafael Brahm <rafael.brahm@uai.cl>: i) CV, ii) 2 page research summary (past and future plans, including the proposed name of the UAI faculty that would act as sponsor), and iii) a list of three researchers willing to write letters of recommendation upon request. These documents will be used for an initial selection of the candidates that will then need to use the official ANID platform to submit the FONDECYT fellowship application sponsored by UAI. We encourage researchers interested in applying to this call to contact the UAI professor working on the topic of interest to identify collaboration projects that will strengthen the eventual proposal.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

There are  postdoc scholarship available.  I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](http://www.nwo.nl/en/funding/our-funding-instruments/nwo/innovational-research-incentives-scheme/veni/index.html) or the [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm).

### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
